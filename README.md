## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5.
- CSS Custom Properties (Variables).
- Flexbox.
- Mobile-first workflow.
- Font-face integration `@font-face`.
- Responsive `clamp()` function for typography.

### What I learned

During this challenge, I practiced:
- Defining and using CSS variables for consistent theming.
- Using clamp() to create responsive font sizes.
- Styling interactive states like :hover, :focus, and :active.
- Making layout components like buttons accessible and visually appealing.
```css
.links a:hover, .links a:focus {
  color: var(--grey-700);
  background-color: var(--green);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, Iâ€™d like to continue improving my responsiveness techniques with CSS Grid, practice accessibility best practices like keyboard navigation, and further explore semantic HTML.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Always my go-to reference.
- [CSS Variables Guide](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/) - Helped me better understand practical use cases.
- [Clamp Generator](https://clamp.font-size.app/) - Very useful for responsive typography.
